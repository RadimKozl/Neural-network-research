        "\n",
        "On your laptop, you are working with a dataset from the **Open Graph Benchmark (OGB)** series, which represents the cutting edge in testing graph algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Povaha dat:** Reprezentuje vztahy mezi proteiny v různých biologických organismech.\n",
        "- **Structure:**\n",
        "    - **Nodes (132,534):** Individual proteins.\n",
        "    - **Edges (39,473,625):** Represent 8 types of interactions (e.g. homology, co-expression).\n",
        "- **Input Features:** Nodes initially have no features of their own. Your process uses **8-dimensional edge vectors** (link features) that are aggregated into nodes as initial features.\n",
        "- **Target:** Multi-label classification. You predict **112 binary labels** at once, corresponding to the presence of a protein in various biological functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "## ***Teorie: Bayesian GraphSAGE***\n",
        "\n",
        "Your model in your laptop is not just a standard neural network, it's an inductive and probabilistic system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***A. GraphSAGE (Inductive learning)***\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike transductive models (like GCN) that require the entire graph in memory, GraphSAGE learns the **aggregation function**. This means that after training, your model can process proteins it never saw during training.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The reason the model is called \"Bayesian\" is the implementation of **Monte Carlo Dropout**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Theory:** Gal & Ghahramani proved that the application of Dropout during inference is mathematically equivalent to the approximation of Gaussian processes.\n",
        "- **Usage in a laptop:** Even when testing (inference), you leave Dropout on. If you run the model N times, you get a distribution of results. The mean is your prediction and the variance is your uncertainty.\n",

        "\n",
        "Here you implement the critical solution for large graphs:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **PyArrow (Parquet):** Use it to store 39 million edges and node properties. Thanks to memory-mapping, you only load what you need.\n",
        "- **SQLite:** Serves as a fast topological index. The model asks SQLite: \"Who are the neighbors of node 42?\" and SQLite returns the rows in the Parquet file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***Phase 2: Model Architecture in NNX***\n",
        "\n",
        "You are using **JAX NNX**, which is an object-oriented API.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Neighbor Sampling:** At each training step, your dataloader randomly selects 10-25 neighbors for each layer. This prevents memory overflow (Memory Out of Memory).\n",
        "- **Multi-label Head:** The last layer has 112 outputs with **Sigmoid** activation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***Phase 3: Training and Optimization***\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Loss:** You use `Binary Cross Entropy` calculated over all 112 labels.\n",
        "- **JIT Kompilace:** Funkce `train_step` je obalena `@jax.jit`, což zkompiluje tvůj Python kód do vysoce optimalizovaného strojového kódu pro GPU/TPU (OpenXLA).\n",
        "\n",
        "## ***Why is this solution \"Production-Ready\"?***\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach, which you have in your laptop, solves the three biggest pain points of graphing tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Memory:** Thanks to PyArrow and neighbor sampling, you don't need 128GB of RAM.\n",
        "2. **Speed:** JAX and XLA compilations allow you to train millions of edges in minutes.\n",
        "3. **Credibility:** The Bayesian element gives your predictions a \"certificate of certainty\", which is essential in biochemistry or industry.\n",
